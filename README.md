# Computational laboratory for BIOL 550 Systematics

> **NOTE** 
> This was developed/organized for a class at Humboldt State University for the spring of 2022. 
> Some of the material has beed modified from another workshop repository [Intro to computational tools at UCSC] (https://github.com/merlyescalona/ucsc-eeb-intro2comptools)

The aim of the lab is to provide students the skills necessary to analyse data from next-geneeration sequencing using phylogenetic methods. Studnts will first learn how to use the command line, then will learn how to use an array of phylgentic software, and finally will gain some skills in python and R coding.

These tutorials are hands-on and were designed to be followed on a Linux machine with all the software pre-installed. However, a list of software can be found at the bottom of this page for your reference.

## What to expect?

At the end of the course participants will be comfortable using the bash environment, using phylogentic software, and writing basic python and R scripts.

W-10 Studentsâ€™ project presentations

## Project requirements

- Work individually or with one classmate.
- Write a python script that solves a problem within your research. Alternatively you can write a python script about a game or something you are passionated about.
- Upload the code to github and write a readme.md file.
- Prepare for a small demostration of the code in the final class.
